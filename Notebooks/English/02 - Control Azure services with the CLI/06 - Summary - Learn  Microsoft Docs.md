The Azure CLI is a good choice for anyone new to Azure command line and
scripting. Its simple syntax and cross-platform compatibility help
reduce the risk of errors when performing regular and repetitive tasks.
In this module, you used the Azure CLI commands to create a resource
group, and deploy a web app by using a small set of commands. These
commands could be combined into a shell script as part of automation
solution.

## Clean up

The sandbox automatically cleans up your resources when you're finished
with this module.

When you're working in your own subscription, it's a good idea at the
end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you
created. Resources left running can cost you money. You can delete
resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire
set of resources.
