PowerShell lets you write commands and execute them immediately. This is
known as **interactive mode**.

Recall that the overall goal in the Customer Relationship Management
(CRM) example is to create three test environments containing Virtual
Machines. You will use resource groups to ensure the VMs are organized
into separate environments: one for unit testing, one for integration
testing, and one for acceptance testing. You only need to create the
resource groups once, so using the PowerShell interactive mode in this
use case is a good choice.

When you enter a command into PowerShell, PowerShell matches the command
to a *cmdlet*, and PowerShell then performs the requested action. We'll
look at some common commands you can use, then we'll look into
installing the Azure support for PowerShell.

## What are PowerShell cmdlets?

A PowerShell command is called a **cmdlet** (pronounced "command-let").
A cmdlet is a command that manipulates a single feature. The term
**cmdlet** is intended to imply "small command". By convention, cmdlet
authors are encouraged to keep cmdlets simple and single-purpose.

The base PowerShell product ships with cmdlets that work with features
such as sessions and background jobs. You can add modules to your
PowerShell installation to get cmdlets that manipulate other features.
For example, there are third-party modules to work with ftp, administer
your operating system, access the file system, and so on.

Cmdlets follow a verb-noun naming convention; for example,
`Get-Process`, `Format-Table`, and `Start-Service`. There is also a
convention for verb choice: "get" to retrieve data, "set" to insert or
update data, "format" to format data, "out" to direct output to a
destination, and so on.

Cmdlet authors are encouraged to include a help file for each cmdlet.
The `Get-Help` cmdlet displays the help file for any cmdlet. For
example, to get help on the `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet, enter the following
statement in a Windows PowerShell session:

``` powershell
Get-Help -Name Get-ChildItem -Detailed
```

## What is a PowerShell module?

Cmdlets are shipped in *modules*. A PowerShell Module is a DLL that
includes the code to process each available cmdlet. You'll load cmdlets
into PowerShell by loading the module in which they're contained. You
can get a list of loaded modules using the `Get-Module` command:

``` powershell
Get-Module
```

This will output something like:

``` console
ModuleType Version    Name                                ExportedCommands
---------- -------    ----                                ----------------

```

## What is the Az PowerShell module?

**Az** is the formal name for the Azure PowerShell module, which
contains cmdlets to work with Azure features. It contains hundreds of
cmdlets that let you control nearly every aspect of every Azure
resource. You can work with resource groups, storage, virtual machines,
Azure Active Directory, containers, machine learning, and so on. This
module is an open-source component [available on
GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell).

Note

You might have seen or used Azure PowerShell commands that used a
`-AzureRM` format. Because Az PowerShell modules now have all the
capabilities of AzureRM PowerShell modules and more, we'll retire
AzureRM PowerShell modules on 29 February 2024. To avoid service
interruptions, [update your scripts](https://aka.ms/azpsmigrate) that
use AzureRM PowerShell modules to use Az PowerShell modules by 29
February 2024. To automatically update your scripts, follow the
[quickstart
guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/quickstart-migrate-azurerm-to-az-automatically).

### Install the Az PowerShell module

The Az PowerShell module is available from a global repository called
the PowerShell Gallery. You can install the module onto your local
machine through the `Install-Module` cmdlet.

To install the latest Azure Az PowerShell module, run the following
commands:

1.  Open the **Start** menu and enter **PowerShell**.

2.  Select the **PowerShell** icon.

3.  Enter the following command, and then press Enter.

    ``` powershell
    Install-Module -Name Az -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery
    ```

This installs the module for your current user (controlled by the
`Scope` parameter).

The command relies on NuGet to retrieve components, so depending on the
version you have installed, you might be prompted to download and
install the latest version of NuGet.

``` console
NuGet provider is required to continue
PowerShellGet requires NuGet provider version '2.8.5.201' or newer to interact with NuGet-based repositories. The NuGet
 provider must be available in 'C:\Program Files\PackageManagement\ProviderAssemblies' or
'C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\PackageManagement\ProviderAssemblies'. You can also install the NuGet provider by running
'Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -MinimumVersion 2.8.5.201 -Force'. Do you want PowerShellGet to install and import
 the NuGet provider now?
 [Y] Yes  [N] No  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"):
```

Enter **Y** and press Enter.

By default, the PowerShell Gallery isn't configured as a trusted
repository for PowerShellGet. Each time you perform an installation from
an untrusted repository, you'll be prompted to confirm you want to
install the module with following output:

``` console
You are installing the modules from an untrusted repository. If you trust this repository, change its
InstallationPolicy value by running the Set-PSRepository cmdlet. Are you sure you want to install the modules from
'PSGallery'?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"):
```

Enter **Y** or **A**, then press Enter.

#### Script execution failed

Depending on your security configuration, `Import-Module` might fail
with something like the following output:

``` console
import-module : File C:\Program Files\PowerShell\Modules\az\6.3.0\Az.psm1 cannot be loaded
because running scripts is disabled on this system. For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at
https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.
At line:1 char:1
+ import-module Az
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : SecurityError: (:) [Import-Module], PSSecurityException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.ImportModuleCommand
```

It might also fail by not responding at all. In this case, press Ctrl+C
to stop the program.

Both behaviors typically indicate that the execution policy is
"Restricted", meaning you can't run modules that you download from an
external source, including the PowerShell Gallery. You can check this by
running the cmdlet `Get-ExecutionPolicy`. If it returns "Restricted",
then do the following:

1.  Use the `SetExecutionPolicy` cmdlet to change the policy to
    "RemoteSigned":

    ``` powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
    ```

    This will prompt you for permission:

    ``` console
    The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose
    you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help topic at
    https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. Do you want to change the execution policy?
    [Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"): Y
    ```

2.  Enter **Y** or **A**, then press Enter.

3.  At the command prompt, use the up arrow on your keyboard and rerun
    the `Install-Module` command for Azure.

You should be able to see the Az module loading. After it completes,
you'll be able to use `Import-Module` to load the cmdlets.

Installing Azure PowerShell on Linux or macOS uses the same commands.

1.  In a terminal, run the following command to launch PowerShell.

    ``` powershell
    pwsh
    ```

2.  Run the following command at the PowerShell prompt to install Azure
    PowerShell.

    ``` powershell
    Install-Module -Name Az -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery -Force
    ```

3.  If you're asked whether you trust modules from **PSGallery**, answer
    **Yes** or **Yes to All**.

### Update a PowerShell module

If you get a warning or error message indicating that a version of the
Azure PowerShell module is already installed, you can update to the
*latest* version by issuing the following command:

``` powershell
Update-Module -Name Az
```

As with the `Install-Module` cmdlet, answer **Yes** or **Yes to All**
when prompted to trust the module. You can also use the `Update-Module`
command to reinstall a module if you're having trouble with it.

## Example: How to create a resource group with Azure PowerShell

Once you've installed the Azure module, you can begin working with
Azure. Let's do a common task: creating a Resource Group. As you know,
we use resource groups to administer related resources together.
Creating a new resource group is one of the first tasks you'll do when
starting a new Azure solution.

There are four steps you need to perform:

1.  Import the Azure cmdlets.

2.  Connect to your Azure subscription.

3.  Create the resource group.

4.  Verify that creation was successful.

The following illustration shows an overview of these steps.

![An illustration showing the steps to create a resource
group.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/automate-azure-tasks-with-powershell/media/5-create-resource-overview.png)

Each step corresponds to a different cmdlet.

### Import the Azure cmdlets

Beginning with PowerShell 3.0, modules are loaded automatically when you
use a cmdlet within the module. It's no longer necessary to manually
import PowerShell modules unless you've changed the default module
autoloading settings.

### Connect

When you're working with a local install of Azure PowerShell, you'll
need to authenticate before you can execute Azure commands. The
`Connect-AzAccount` cmdlet prompts for your Azure credentials, then
connects to your Azure subscription. It has many optional parameters,
but if all you need is an interactive prompt, you don't need any
parameters:

``` powershell
Connect-AzAccount
```

### Work with subscriptions

If you're new to Azure, you probably only have a single subscription.
But if you've been using Azure for a while, you might have created
multiple Azure subscriptions. You can configure Azure PowerShell to
execute commands against a particular subscription.

You can only be in one subscription at a time. Use the `Get-AzContext`
cmdlet to determine which subscription is active. If it's not the
correct one, you can change subscriptions using another cmdlet.

1.  Get a list of all subscription names in your account with the
    `Get-AzSubscription` command.

2.  Change the subscription by passing the name of the one to select.

``` powershell
Set-AzContext -Subscription '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'
```

If you need to look up the **Subscription ID**, open Azure and select
**Subscriptions** on the home page.

### Get a list of all resource groups

You can retrieve a list of all Resource Groups in the active
subscription.

``` powershell
Get-AzResourceGroup
```

To get a more concise view, you can send the output from the
`Get-AzResourceGroup` to the `Format-Table` cmdlet using a pipe '\|'.

``` powershell
Get-AzResourceGroup | Format-Table
```

The output will look something like this:

``` console
ResourceGroupName                  Location       ProvisioningState Tags TagsTable ResourceId
-----------------                  --------       ----------------- ---- --------- ----------
cloud-shell-storage-southcentralus southcentralus Succeeded                        /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000...
ExerciseResources                  eastus         Succeeded                        /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000...
```

### Create a resource group

As you know, when you're creating resources in Azure, you'll always
place them into a resource group for management purposes. A resource
group is often one of the first things you'll create when starting a new
application.

You can create resource groups by using the `New-AzResourceGroup`
cmdlet. You must specify a name and location. The name must be unique
within your subscription. The location determines where the metadata for
your resource group will be stored (which may be important to you for
compliance reasons). You use strings like "West US", "North Europe", or
"West India" to specify the location. As with most of the Azure cmdlets,
`New-AzResourceGroup` has many optional parameters. However, the core
syntax is:

``` powershell
New-AzResourceGroup -Name <name> -Location <location>
```

Note

Remember, we will be working in an active Azure sandbox, which creates
the Resource Group for you. Use the command above if you prefer to work
in your own subscription.

### Verify the resources

The `Get-AzResource` lists your Azure resources, which is useful here to
verify the resource group creation was successful.

``` powershell
Get-AzResource
```

Like the `Get-AzResourceGroup` command, you can get a more concise view
through the `Format-Table` cmdlet:

``` powershell
Get-AzResource | Format-Table
```

You can also filter it to specific resource groups to only list
resources associated with that group:

``` powershell
Get-AzResource -ResourceGroupName ExerciseResources
```

### Create an Azure Virtual Machine

Another common task you can do with PowerShell is to create VMs.

Azure PowerShell provides the `New-AzVm` cmdlet to create a virtual
machine. The cmdlet has many parameters to let it handle the large
number of VM configuration settings. Most of the parameters have
reasonable default values, so we only need to specify five things:

-   **ResourceGroupName**: The resource group into which the new VM will
    be placed.
-   **Name**: The name of the VM in Azure.
-   **Location**: Geographic location where the VM will be provisioned.
-   **Credential**: An object containing the username and password for
    the VM admin account. We'll use the `Get-Credential` cmdlet. This
    cmdlet will prompt for a username and password and package it into a
    credential object.
-   **Image**: The operating system image to use for the VM, which is
    typically a Linux distribution or Windows Server.

``` powershell
   New-AzVm
       -ResourceGroupName <resource group name>
       -Name <machine name>
       -Credential <credentials object>
       -Location <location>
       -Image <image name>
```

You can supply these parameters directly to the cmdlet as shown above.
Alternatively, you can use other cmdlets to configure the virtual
machine, such as `Set-AzVMOperatingSystem`, `Set-AzVMSourceImage`,
`Add-AzVMNetworkInterface`, and `Set-AzVMOSDisk`.

Here's an example that strings the `Get-Credential` cmdlet together with
the `-Credential` parameter:

``` powershell
New-AzVM -Name MyVm -ResourceGroupName ExerciseResources -Credential (Get-Credential) ...
```

The `AzVM` suffix is specific to VM-based commands in PowerShell. There
are several others you can use:

  Command          Description
  ---------------- -------------------------------------
  `Remove-AzVM`    Deletes an Azure VM.
  `Start-AzVM`     Start a stopped VM.
  `Stop-AzVM`      Stop a running VM.
  `Restart-AzVM`   Restart a VM.
  `Update-AzVM`    Updates the configuration for a VM.

#### Example: Getting information for a VM

You can list the VMs in your subscription using the `Get-AzVM -Status`
command. This command also supports entering a specific VM by including
the `-Name` property. Here, we'll assign it to a PowerShell variable:

``` powershell
$vm = Get-AzVM  -Name MyVM -ResourceGroupName ExerciseResources
```

The interesting thing is that now your VM is an *object* with which you
can interact. For example, you can make changes to that object, then
push changes back to Azure by using the `Update-AzVM` command:

``` powershell
$ResourceGroupName = "ExerciseResources"
$vm = Get-AzVM  -Name MyVM -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName
$vm.HardwareProfile.vmSize = "Standard_DS3_v2"

Update-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName  -VM $vm
```

The interactive mode in PowerShell is appropriate for one-off tasks. In
our example, we'll likely use the same resource group for the lifetime
of the project, so creating it interactively is reasonable. Interactive
mode is often quicker and easier for this task than writing a script and
executing that script exactly once.
